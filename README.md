## Transformer Model Implementation

This repository contains a PyTorch-based implementation of a Transformer model, including multi-head attention, positional encoding, and feed-forward layers for natural language processing tasks.

## Overview

It uses an attention mechanism to process input sequences in parallel, making it highly efficient for tasks like text generation.

### Key Components:
- **Multi-Head Attention**: Allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously.
- **Positional Encoding**: Adds information about the position of words in the sequence.
- **Encoder-Decoder Architecture**: Processes the input sequence with the encoder and generates the output sequence with the decoder.
- **Text Generation**: The model can generate text based on a given input using the `generate` method.

## Features

- Multi-Head Attention
- Positional Encoding
- Encoder & Decoder Layers
- Text Generation using GPT-2

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch 1.10+
- transformers (for GPT-2)

## Model Hyperparameters
Here are the key parameters for the model:

- src_vocab_size: The size of the source vocabulary.
- tgt_vocab_size: The size of the target vocabulary.
- d_model: The dimension of the model (embedding size).
- num_heads: The number of attention heads.
- num_layers: The number of encoder and decoder layers.
- d_ff: The dimension of the feed-forward network.
- max_seq_length: The maximum sequence length.
- dropout: The dropout rate.

## Usage
1. Prepare Your Dataset
Place your text data in a file (e.g., input.txt).

2. Train the Model
Use the training loop to train the model on your dataset.

3. Generate Text
Once trained, use the generate method to create new text based on a prompt.
